Information to use this project
* Please open the file "index.html" and on line number 12 provide your host details. (I have provided my local host address on that so you need to change it).
* On client side, I've used Bootstrap, JQuery, W3 CSS as reference to make the display better.
* When you run the project you will get this output.

* Type the id or title of the movie you want to search and click on “Go” button. (I typed “Aquaman” and it will give me all the movie which contains name Aquaman).
* Only first page will be displayed because by default OMDP api returns page 1.(We can specify the pages to display.)
* Given below is the screenshot of the result.


* If you click on the view button, it will provide details about the Title, Release Date, Genre, Director and Writer. Furthermore, it will also display the plot of the movie if the movie was released after 2015.


* You can also go back to the previous page if you click on the “Go back” text.
* If the entered title or id of the movie is not found, then it will provide 400 “Not Found Error”.

* If there is any other error except 400, then it will display 500 Error.
