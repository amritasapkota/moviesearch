* Open the file "index.html" with any text editor and on line number 12 provide your host details. (I have provided my local host address on that so you need to change it).

Instruction for application use

* Then you will get an interface where you can type the movie you want to search and click on “Go” button. 

* After then you will have maximum of ten results of the movie details if the movie exists in the OMDB server database. 

* You can view detail about any shown movie result by clicking “View” button. It gives you Title, Release Date, Genre, Director and Writer of the movie. Furthermore, it will also display the plot of the movie if the movie was released after 2015.

* You can also go back to the previous page if you click on the “Go back” text.
* If the entered title or id of the movie is not found, then it will provide 400 “Not Found Error”.

* If there is any other error except 400, then it will display 500 Error.

* On client side, I've used Bootstrap, JQuery, W3 CSS as reference to make the display better.
